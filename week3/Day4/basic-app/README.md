                                Today I've learned
                                How to install the node js using nvm. Through NVM we can install the any version of node whenever we need, Becuase some projects don't support the current version.
                                Second I've learned hoe to create the react app using cmd terminal and how to install 
                                the react-router-dom library.
                                Then I've used the props how to pass the data from one component to another then I've learned we can pass the arary and object as initial value of the state,
                                Then I learned how I can show the useref hook and how to pass the ref into our html code.
                                How I can Add the todos, check them as mark and remanibg unmarked todo should show in below in the form of number the I applied the toggleing function for this purpose. 
                                At the end I use clear button to clear all todos.
